<h3>Universal Ad ID editor</h3>
<p>After having drag and dropped (or from the "File" menu) some files and selecting the Ad-iD editor from the toolbar, the Universal Ad ID view displays information (Universal Ad ID registry and Universal Ad ID value) about each file in a table.<br/>
Then it is possible to edit Universal Ad ID registry and Universal Ad ID value, and save this metadata.</p>

<h3>Automatic filling</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In case a file is not supported, the line is in red, not modifiable, and a message is displayed</li>
<li>If a file already has Universal Ad ID metadata, Registry and Value are displayed</li>
<li>Else if a file name is conforming to standard Ad-ID identifier (11 or 12 alphanumeric characters), Registry is filled with "ad-id.org" and Value is filled with the file name</li>
<li>Else Registry is pre-filled with "ad-id.org", and Value cell is in light red (empty Value is not authorized)</li>
</ul>
A cell in light red means that the content is not valid (so the file can not be saved).<br/>
A line in bold means that the metadata is valid and the file can be saved (click on the "Save" button or the "Save" item in the "File" menu)
</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If Registry is empty, Value must be empty (meaning that the Universal Ad ID metadata is removed)</li>
<li>If Registry is "ad-id.org", Value must conform to a standard Ad-ID format (11 or 12 alphanumeric characters)</li>
</ul>
